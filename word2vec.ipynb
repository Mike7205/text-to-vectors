The meanings are represented as n-dimensional vectors, which in this case will be derived from the hidden layer of a word2vec model. These embeddings can be compared to each other in an n-dimensional space, with words that have similar meaning in the training corpus ending up close together, while those with dissimilar meanings being far apart.\n",
